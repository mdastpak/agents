        2. Netgear Nighthawk AX12 firmware v1.0.11.116 has TCP optimization bug
        3. During market hours, server validation completes in 23ms vs normal 67ms
        4. UI update task expects 67ms minimum delay for memory management
        5. When validation completes in <30ms, UI accesses deallocated memory
